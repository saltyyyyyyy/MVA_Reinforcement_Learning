Alessandro Lazaric

Assignment 1: 
* Implement MDP model, as well as value iteration, policy iteration and Q-Learning algorithm

Assignment 2: 
* Implement UCB1 and Thompson Sampling algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
* Implement LinUCB algorithm for linear bandit based movie recommendation.

Assignment 3:
